This was a open-ended solo project to create a to-do list utilizing any of the technologies we’ve learned at Prime Digital Academy so far.  I chose to use primarily jQuery to create a shopping list web app.  

I spent quite a bit of time thinking about the user’s experience when using the list generator.  Initially, the app used lots of buttons, which was not very friendly for a computer based user. I eliminated the buttons, made it so the user could just hit enter after entering an item, and then the focus automatically comes back to the text input box. 

Had I been designing it for mobile, I would have utilized buttons, as it is easier to tap on a button for a mobile user.

I also added a nice animation to the list item removal.
